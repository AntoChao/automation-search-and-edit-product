# automation-search-and-edit-product
this mini project is just me practising some basic concept of python and make a mini program for my familys wrk.

There are 2 functions of this project:
  1- Automation search select:
    it allows people to input information like product name, DPI, height, width to automatically search images that applied those conditions. After searching, user is       able to select one of those images, it will be save on folder imagenes_finalizados. At the same time, user can choose to edit the selected image
  2- Automation edit:
    for now, the project only automate 2 edit function: remove background and super resolution. user need to save the only one imageon in folder "LR", and choose the         edit.
    *** remove background function is based on API https://www.remove.bg
    *** super resolution function is based on a ai model tranied and preprocess by https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN, huge thanks for the open source.
